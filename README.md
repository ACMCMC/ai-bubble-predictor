# AI Bubble Predictor

AI is a very trendy topic nowadays. Everyone is talking about it, and we hear about it everywhere. But can it really deliver on its promises?

I don't think so. I think that AI is just a bubble that will burst soon. It's a great technology, but it's not as powerful as people think. As any tool, it has its limitations â€” and those have been overlooked by many.

In this project, I will build a model to predict when the AI bubble will burst. I will use historical data about a phenomenon I believe was similar to the AI bubble (the dot-com bubble) to train an LSTM model. Then, I will use this model to generate a hypothesis about when the AI bubble will burst.

I hope this project will help people understand the limitations of AI and avoid the consequences of the burst of the AI bubble.
